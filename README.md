An analysis of ' green' stocks for Steve
## Overview of Project
  Steve really liked the workbook we prepared for him to analyze 'green' stock trends for 2017 & 2018. In this report, we refactored our subroutine so that Steve and his parents can continue to use this workbook to

## Purpose
Steve's parents want to invest in 'green' stocks. 

## Summary of Analysis

Some advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code are:

You need to perform code refactoring in small steps. Make tiny changes in your program, each of the small changes makes your code slightly better and leaves the application in a working state.

#### Advantages:

*Refactoring pre-existing code allows us to improve or update the code without chaning, or even improving the efficacy, of the sub-routine.
*By refactoring code, we can improve it's readability, making it easier to understand. If someone else needs to use our code in the future, or if we need to come back to it months later, having it refactored to be easy to undertand will allow us to make any needed changes with ease.
*Refactoring code allows us to find and fix any bugs. While a macro may be running correctly, there may be a line of code that could be refactored to more efficiently account for future variables.

#### Disadvantages:

*Refactoring can affect the intended outcomes of an analysis.
*Refacroting can be time consuming, and lead to creating more problems than they solve. While we may be aiming to have a code become more efficeint in analyzing a specific data trend, we may destabalize the macro's complex coding sets.

## Results

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Conclusion Summary: 

In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?


A long procedure may contain the same line of code in several locations, you can change the logic to eliminate the duplicate lines.
